You’ll learn how to use UNIX tools to process and clean data, covering:

* `curl` (or `wget`) to fetch data from websites.
* `gzip` (or `xz`) to compress and decompress files.
* `wc` to count lines, words, and characters in text.
* `head` and `tail` to get the start and end of files.
* `cut` to extract specific columns from text.
* `uniq` to de-duplicate lines.
* `sort` to sort lines.
* `grep` to filter lines containing specific text.
* `sed` to search and replace text.
* `awk` for more complex text processing.
