I\u2019ve been running a high fever since yesterday, and while I managed to complete my JAVA OPPE this morning, I started feeling much worse afterward. I felt it was necessary to get checked out by a doctor and unfortunately had to miss ROE as a result.\nI was wondering if there might be any possibility of taking the ROE at a later time? Please let me know if there\u2019s anything I can do or if any arrangements can be made."
