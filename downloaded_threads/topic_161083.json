This makes the code much easier to read and differentiate from non-code text. It also makes it easier for people to copy code snippets and run it themselves. Visit this link for more details: Extended Syntax | Markdown Guide.\nA friendly suggestion: kindly go through Discourse Docs! \n\nDeadline: 26 Jan 2025, midnight IST\n@carlton @Jivraj Please keep an eye on this thread for support."

With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.\nI have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection."
