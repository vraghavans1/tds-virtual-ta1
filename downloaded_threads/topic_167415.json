Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as \u2018dockerfile\u2019. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.\nShall I just change the name of the file from \u2018dockerfile\u2019 to \u2018Dockerfile\u2019 in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?"

On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn\u2019t changed on GitHub repo.\nSir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too \u201cRename dockerfile to Dokerfile\u201d . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.\nSir it is a humble request to please consider it.\nWarm Regards,\nSatvik Sawhney\n23f2003680\nScreenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.53.10 PM1889\u00d7467 54 KB"
