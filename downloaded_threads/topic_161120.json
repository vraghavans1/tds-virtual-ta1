This makes the code much easier to read and differentiate from non-code text. It also makes it easier for people to copy code snippets and run it themselves. Visit this link for more details: Extended Syntax | Markdown Guide.\nA friendly suggestion: kindly go through Discourse Docs! \n\nDeadline: Sunday, February 2, 2025 6:29 PM\n@carlton @Jivraj"
