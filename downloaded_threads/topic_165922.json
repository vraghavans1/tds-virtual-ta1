        "cooked": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn\u2019t installing directly via pip be more practical?\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I\u2019d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently."

        "cooked": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\n\n\nIsolation \u2013 Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n\n\nReproducibility \u2013 A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n\n\nPortability \u2013 You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n\n\u2022 Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n\u2022 Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\n\nUsing requirements.txt\n\n\u2022 Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n\u2022 Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer\u2019s setup.\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n\u2022 If you don\u2019t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n\u2022 If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\nHandling Version Conflicts\n\u2022 If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n\u2022 Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n\u2022 Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n\u2022 Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\nBest Practices Summary\n\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\nUse a requirements.txt file for reproducibility.\nPin versions cautiously\u2014avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\n\nKind regards"

        "cooked": "For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it\u2019s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.\nWhereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.\n\nFor project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement\n\n\n\n\n\n 24f2006531:\n\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?\n\n\nComing to your second question,\nThe first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone\u2019s project it\u2019s better to use requirements.txt.\n\n\n\n\n 24f2006531:\n\nMy understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation\n\n\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.\n\nNever try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you\n"

This would definitely address the error I mentioned in my question."
