Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.\nUnfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.\nChanging it now will not suddenly make it eligible.\nThese things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These \u201cminor\u201d things matter.\nIts a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.\nWe had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.\nI know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.\nKindest regards"
