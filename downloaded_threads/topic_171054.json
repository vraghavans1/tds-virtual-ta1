We also tested it with our friends\u2019 GA questions, and it\u2019s working as expected.\nThis project was a team effort by me and two friends [ @lakshaygarg654 and @23f2004637 ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment.\nI would love the opportunity to demonstrate our project to TA and Anand Sir in a Google Meet session on March 31st (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th).\nIf you can spare some time for a quick look at our project, it would be awesome! Looking forward to your response."

However, I won\u2019t be able to present the project in a public session as my Azure API URL would be exposed, and since it incurs costs per usage, I need to keep it secure.\nI\u2019d prefer a private meet to demonstrate the project. Please let me know if that can be arranged. Looking forward to discussing it!"
