This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos you gave us.\nFor clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.\nHow to fix bugs in our scripts\nCreate Pull requests to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1 .\nDocker Image Architecture Issue Report\nIf your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:\nSubmit Report\nBug fixes\nIf you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.\nKind regards,\nTDS Team"
