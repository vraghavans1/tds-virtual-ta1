From containerization to prompt tuning.\nBut I am personally offended by one thing\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow dare you give bonus marks on Week 7?\nI skipped it \u2014 just like many \u2014 because we were told only best 4 of 7 would count.\nI demand justice. And a belly rub.\u201d\n\u2013 , Full-stack Labrador & Part-time Therapist\n\n\n Moral of the story:\nLet your pets help with your coursework.\nYou get the grade. They get the rage."
