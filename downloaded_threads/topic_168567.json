Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process. \nWhat does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. \n\nImplicit learning is \u201cHow much can they answer if woken up from sleep?\u201d\nExplicit learning is \u201cHow much can they answer given time and Internet?\u201d\n\nSome may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They\u2019ll answer those in a few seconds. \nSome, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That\u2019s explicit learning. But it takes time\u2026\n  \n\n"
