I saw a similar older thread where it was mentioned that this is not something to worry about but now it is showing in the portal that I am not allowed to take the End Term Exam. What can be done for this?\nSS1895\u00d71010 167 KB"

Which is in the link provided (it is actually in the screen shot you have provided).\nAll the previous GA 1 through 4 were also exactly the same.\nWe have no evidence you ever submitted any of the other GAs except GA1.\nKind regards"
